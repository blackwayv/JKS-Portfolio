# Joshua K Smith Portfolio Website

This is my professional portfolio website, for recruiters and curious visitors. I like the way it looks, but I would love to hear any criticisms/concerns at inq@joshuaksmith.me

### Installation

Note: If you are trying to run the full portfolio website, you need to create a directory named 'portfolio-files' and clone https://github.com/blackwayv/OSRS-Planner-App.git and https://github.com/blackwayv/Greenfield-Product-Portal.git, install their dependencies, build both webpack bundles, and THEN you can visit both of the inner apps.
In your bash terminal, copy and pase this to clone the repository:

`
git clone https://github.com/blackwayv/mvp.git
`

### Starting:

First, install dependencies so the program can run:

`
npm install
`

Then, you will need to use run scripts to prepare the files:

`
npm run build
`

Finally, you are ready to start the website!

`
npm start
`

### Usage:

Since this repo is an amalgamation of three projects, I would recommend looking at the code and website independently.
